# C++ Assignment
There are 3 programs in this assignment. 

## 1. Prime Numbers
The first program prints the first 107 prime numbers. The logic used is based on the premise that if any number above 1 but below or equal to the square root of a prime number divides evenly into the number being tested if prime, then the number being tested is not a prime number.

## 2. Leap Years
The second program asks the user to input a year and checks to see if that year is a leap year. The logic used is to check if the year is divisible by 4, 100 and 400. If it is divisible by 400 then it is a leap year. If it is divisible by 100 but not 400 then it is not a leap year. If it is divisible by 4 then it is a leap year.

## 3. Arithmetic Game
The third program asks the user to carry out operations on two numbers, or exit the program. The available options are:

1. Perform modulus operation on two numbers
2. Perform multiplication operation on two numbers
3. Perform subtraction operation on two numbers
4. Exit

The user then chooses the operation and is asked to guess the answer a maximum of two times. If the user guesses correctly a congratulatory message is displayed, but if the user guesses incorrecty both times, the correct answer is displayed and the menu is displayed again.
